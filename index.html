          <strong>The Charminar</strong> , located in

          in 1591 by <strong> Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah</strong> , the fifth ruler
          of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. It is believed to have been constructed
          either to commemorate the end of a deadly plague or to mark the
          founding of Hyderabad. The structure’s name, Charminar, means
          <strong>“Four Minarets,”</strong> each rising to about 56 meters.
          Built in Indo-Islamic architectural style with Persian influences, it
          features grand arches on each side and intricate stucco decorations.
          Today, the Charminar stands not only as a historical monument but also

          Bazaar..
